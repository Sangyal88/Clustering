# Clustering
# This clustering based algorithm aims at improving the existing K-means algorithm by reducing the computation time by eleminating the optimal centroid calculation process. Since the step for serching an optimal centroid is eliminated the number of itterations are also reduced hence resulting in a faster grouping/clustering of pixels.
